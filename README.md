# Difference-of-Squares-Visual-Proof
A visual proof of the difference of squares - made with Manim! The code isn't *incredible*, but it works :) I *do* know about groups, but for some reason it was making the animations involving them choppy, so there's like 20 extra lines of code :/ maybe I could have made a custom animation... but for just one use case... too much hassle
